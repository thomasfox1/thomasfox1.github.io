            Claude Giroux
            </div>
            <p>-Giroux is the best player the Flyers have had in many years. He is more of a finesse player and he has all the intangibles of an all-star caliber player. Hopefully he stays around in Philadelphia for a long time.</p>
            <div id="shayne">
            Shayne Gostisbehere
            </div>
            <p>-New to the team, this defenseman has been making a definite impact on a team where there were not many good defenders. He is able to score the puck and dish out assists as well as covering the best opponent on the opposing team.</p>
            <div id="simmonds">
            Wayne Simmonds
            </div>
            <p>-Simmonds is the Associate Captain of this team. He is a tough, gritty player that does not shy away from hitting or getting in fights with opposing players. He is the personification of the city of Philadelphia and a fan favorite.</p>

            Claude Giroux

            <p>-Giroux has been the best player and the captain of this team for around three years now. He is an excellent goal scorer with a good feel for the game as he lead the team with 45 assists. The team had a down year but Giroux bought the lowly Flyers to the playoffs</p>

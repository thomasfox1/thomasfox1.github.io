            Nerlens Noel
            </div>
            <p>-Noel has been the leader of this team for about three years now. He is a tall, lanky player who excells on the defensive side of the court. His offense is subpar and he will need some work if he is the center the Sixers decide to keep. He is a very solid player though and is the defensive heart of the roster.</p>
            <div id="ish">
            Ish Smith
            </div>
            <p>-Smith provided the spark the Sixers needed when he was brought back to the team midway through last season. He is a very good point guard who can make plays at crucial times. With the upcoming NBA Draft Smith may be getting some competition as the Sixers are probably going to draft a couple guards. He is a solid player but definitely not top tier. </p>
            <div id="jahlil">
            Jahlil Okafor
            </div>
            <p>-This past season Jahlil Okafor was a rookie for the Sixers. In his first year he was the leading scorer and was the second leaders in rebounds. He is an extremely gifted center with great scoring abilities. He is not great at defense and will need some work if he plans to remain the starter in Philadelphia.</p>

            Jahlil Okafor
            </div>
            <p>-Jahlil Okafor joined the Sixers roster after his firat year of Duke was completed. He is 6'11 which is not a great size for a center. This does not hinder his ability to get to the rim against bigger defenders. Okafor is also a very good mid-range shooter. His by far the face of this lackluster team who only managed to win 10 games last season. Okafor is going to have to compete against injured players and draft picks for minutes next season.</p>

            Aaron Nola
            </div>
            <p>-The Phillies came off an abismal year and pitching was one of the team's biggest weaknesses. Aaron Nola has taken it upon himself to bring back a quality pitching staff. With only 30 games into the season, Nola has played 4 games and has a record of 2 and 2. He has a current ERA of 2.93 but he should be the best pitcher on the team by the end of the season.</p>
            <div id="howard1">
            Ryan Howard
            </div>
            <p>-Howard has had an extremely tough time getting back to where he was in the late 2000's. So far in the season he has not been doing well and he has a batting average of .189. If the Phillies want to start winning some games they need this slugger to start hitting more homeruns. They also need his veteran leadership more than ever.</p>
            <div id="maikel">
            Maikel Franco
            </div>
            <p>-Maikel Franco is the new budding superstar on the roster. With the losses of players like Chase Utley, Jimmy Rollins, and Shane Victorino we needed a new guy who could come in and make an impact. So far, Franco has been that guy. He has taken a team that did horrible last year to a point where they now have a winning record. The Phillies need to hold on to Franco if they want to succeed in the future.</p>

            <p>-Franco has been turning into the Phillies go-to-guy since he joined the team a couple of seasons ago. He is a gifted hitter and a good fielder. He has a lot of room for improvement but right now he is definitely the face of the team. We need to keep him healthy and playing well if we want to win.</p>

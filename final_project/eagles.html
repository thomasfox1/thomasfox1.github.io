            Carson Wentz
            </div>
            <p>-Wentz was drafted 2nd overall in the 2016 NFL draft. Although Wentz played for North Dakota State, a minor college program, scouts love his athleticism and his size. In addition he also has great arm strength and field vision. Wentz is the probable replacement for Sam Bradford who failed to get the job done last season.</p>
            <div id="jenk">
            Malcolm Jenkins
            </div>
            <p>-He is one of the best safties in the league. He had the most total tackles on the team last season as well as the most solo tackles. Although he did not record any sacks, he had two interceptions as well as 3 forced fumbles. He was added to the pro-bowl roster for the last season. </p>
            <div id="sproles">
            Darren Sproles
            </div>
            <p>-Sproles is a pro bowl caliber player who has been with the team for a few years. Sproles is the swiss army knife of the team as he is used as a runningback, a receiver, a kick returner and a punt returner. He played a limited amount of games last season but his healthy and ready for the upcoming year.</p>

            Fletcher Cox
            </div>
            <p>-After being snubbed in past seasons, Philadelphia Eagles defensive end Fletcher Cox is FINALLY headed to the Pro Bowl. Cox has had a great year for the Eagles. The 25-year-old defensive lineman is a beast. He's recorded 7.5 sacks, 12 quarterback hits, and 46 hurries through 14 games so far. Cox also has two pass deflections, three forced fumbles, and two fumble recoveries. Cox was named NFC Defensive Player of the Week in October. He was also voted as the team's winner of the Ed Block Courage Award.</p>

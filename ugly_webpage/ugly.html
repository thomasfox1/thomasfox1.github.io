<h1>Poems by Lewis Carrol</h1>


<h2>Jabberwocky</h2>
<div id= "j1">
<ul>
  <li>'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves</li>
  <li>Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:</li>
  <li>All mimsy were the borogoves,</li>
  <li>And the mome raths outgrabe.</li>

<img src="jabberwocky.jpg" id="image1" alt="Jabberwocky"/>
<li>'Beware the <em>Jabberwock</em>, my son!</li>
<li>The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!</li>
<li>Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun</li>
<li>The frumious Bandersnatch!'</li>
</div>

<div id="j2">
<ol>
  <li>He took his vorpal sword in hand:</li>
  <li>Long time the manxome foe he sought --</li>
  <li>So rested he by the Tumtum tree,</li>
  <li>And stood a while in thought.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li>And, as in uffish thought he stood,</li>
  <li>The <em>Jabberwock</em>, with eyes of flame,</li>
  <li>Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,</li>
  <li>And burbled as it came!</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div id="j3">
<ul>
  <li>One two! One two! And through and through</li>
  <li>The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!</li>
  <li>He left it dead, and with its head</li>
  <li>He went galumphing back.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>'And hast thou slain the <em>Jabberwock</em>?</li>
  <li>Come to my arms, my beamish boy!</li>
  <li>Oh frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'</li>
  <li>He chortled in his joy.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves</li>
  <li>Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:</li>
  <li>All mimsy were the borogoves,</li>
  <li>And the mome raths outgrabe.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3>The Walrus and the Carpenter</h3>
<div id="w1">
<ol>
  <li>The sun was shining on the sea,</li>
  <li>Shining with all his might:</li>
  <li>He did his very best to make</li>
  <li>The billows smooth and bright --</li>
  <li>And this was odd, because it was</li>
  <li>The middle of the night.</li>
</ol>

<img src="walruscarpenter.jpg" id="image2" alt="Walrus and Carpenter"/>

<ol>
  <li>The moon was shining sulkily,</li>
  <li>Because she thought the sun</li>
  <li>Had got no business to be there</li>
  <li>After the day was done --</li>
  <li>'It's very rude of him.' she said,</li>
  <li>'To come and spoil the fun!'</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="w2">
<ul>
  <li>The sea was wet as wet could be,</li>
  <li>The sands were dry as dry.</li>
  <li>You could not see a cloud, because</li>
  <li>No cloud was in the sky:</li>
  <li>No birds were flying overhead --</li>
  <li>There were no birds to fly.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>The Walrus and the Carpenter</li>
  <li>Were walking close at hand:</li>
  <li>They wept like anything to see</li>
  <li>Such quantities of sand:</li>
  <li>'If this were only cleared away,'</li>
  <li>They said, 'it would be grand.'</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="w3">
<ol>
  <li>'If seven maids with seven mops</li>
  <li>Swept it for half a year,</li>
  <li>Do you suppose,' the Walrus said,</li>
  <li>'That they could get it clear?'</li>
  <li>'l doubt it,' said the Carpenter,</li>
  <li>And shed a bitter tear.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>'O Oysters, come and walk with us!</li>
<li>The Walrus did beseech.</li>
<li>'A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,</li>
<li>Along the briny beach:</li>
<li>We cannot do with more than four,</li>
<li>To give a hand to each.'</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="w4">
<ul>
<li>The eldest Oyster looked at him,</li>
<li>But never a word he said:</li>
<li>The eldest Oyster winked his eye,</li>
<li>And shook his heavy head --</li>
<li>Meaning to say he did not choose</li>
<li>To leave the oyster-bed.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Out four young Oysters hurried up.</li>
<li>All eager for the treat:</li>
<li>Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,</li>
<li>Their shoes were clean and neat --</li>
<li>And this was odd, because, you know,</li>
<li>They hadn't any feet.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="w5">
<ul>
  <li>Four other Oysters followed them,</li>
  <li>And yet another four;</li>
  <li>And thick and fast they came at last,</li>
  <li>And more, and more, and more --</li>
  <li>All hopping through the frothy waves,</li>
  <li>And scrambling to the shore.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>The Walrus and the Carpenter</li>
  <li>Walked on a mile or so,</li>
  <li>And then they rested on a rock</li>
  <li>Conveniently low:</li>
  <li>And all the little Oysters stood</li>
  <li>And waited in a row.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="w6">
<ol>
  <li>'The time has come,' the Walrus said,</li>
  <li>'To talk of many things:</li>
  <li>Of shoes -- and ships -- and sealing wax --</li>
  <li>Of cabbages -- and kings --</li>
  <li>And why the sea is boiling hot --</li>
  <li>And whether pigs have wings.'</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>'But wait a bit,' the Oysters cried,</li>
  <li>'Before we have our chat;</li>
  <li>For some of us are out of breath,</li>
  <li>And all of us are fat!'</li>
  <li>'No hurry!' said the Carpenter.</li>
  <li>They thanked him much for that.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="w7">
<ol>
  <li>'A loaf of bread,' the Walrus said,</li>
  <li>'Is what we chiefly need:</li>
  <li>Pepper and vinegar besides</li>
  <li>Are very good indeed --</li>
  <li>Now, if you're ready, Oysters dear,</li>
  <li>We can begin to feed.'</li>
</ol>
<img src="walruscarpenter3.jpg" id="image3" alt="Walrus and Carpenter"/>

<ul>
  <li>'But not on us!' the Oysters cried,</li>
  <li>Turning a little blue.</li>
  <li>'After such kindness, that would be</li>
  <li>A dismal thing to do!'</li>
  <li>'The night is fine,' the Walrus said,</li>
  <li>'Do you admire the view?'</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="w8">
<ol>
  <li>'It was so kind of you to come!</li>
  <li>And you are very nice!'</li>
  <li>The Carpenter said nothing but</li>
  <li>'Cut us another slice-</li>
  <li>I wish you were not quite so deaf-</li>
  <li>I've had to ask you twice!'</li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li>'It seems a shame,' the Walrus said,</li>
  <li>'To play them such a trick.</li>
  <li>After we've brought them out so far,</li>
  <li>And made them trot so quick!'</li>
  <li>The Carpenter said nothing but</li>
  <li>'The butter's spread too thick!'</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="w9">
<ul>
  <li>'I weep for you,'the Walrus said:</li>
  <li>'I deeply sympathize.'</li>
  <li>With sobs and tears he sorted out</li>
  <li>Those of the largest size,</li>
  <li>Holding his pocket-handkerchief</li>
  <li>Before his streaming eyes.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>'O Oysters,' said the Carpenter,</li>
  <li>'You've had a pleasant run!</li>
  <li>Shall we be trotting home again?'</li>
  <li>But answer came there none --</li>
  <li>And this was scarcely odd, because</li>
  <li>They'd eaten every one.</li>
</ol>
